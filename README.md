Refactor homework

On this homework we had to change the provided html, simplify it. The way i went about it was, start at the top and make my way to the bottom. Closing different  divs and observing what was contained in each tag. That way i could see the extense usage of div tags.  Once i noticed that, i started looking at a different more proper html structure and noticed it was missing a Header, Footer, and Section elements. Then procceded to simplify the code by replacing each tag.
